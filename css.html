    <h1>What is a tree?</h1>
    <p>We know trees are made of wood and have a trunk, branches and leaves, but how do we define what makes
         a tree… a tree?</p>

     How do we define a tree and what makes it different
      from other forest plants and organisms? <br>
      In this post,
      we look a little closer at the 
      common characteristics of a tree and some of the science behind
      its shape, size and structure.

    <h2>Definition of a tree</h2>
    <p>A tree is a tall plant that can live a very long time. <br>
        It has a single stem or trunk and branches that support leaves. <br>
         Beneath the ground, a tree has a root system that acts as an anchor 
        and stores the water and nutrients the plant needs to grow.</p>

        <h3>See our different types of tree. </h3>
        <h4>Tree-height</h4>
        <p>The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) definition
             says that for a plant species to be a tree, <br> it should reach 5m tall if the
              growing conditions are good.  <br> That's 
            in developing countries – in developed countries,
             the height goes up to 7m.</p>
        <p>The National Forest Inventory (IFN) takes a similar approach. It defines a tree as
           a woody plant with a
             bare stem at its base and can grow <br> to a height greater than or equal to 5m 
             when it reaches maturity.</p>
